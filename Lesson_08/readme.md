Finally, we are talking about modules with standard javascript.  To run modules in your web page, you need to use the:

```html
    <script type="module" src="js/script.js"></script>
```

The catch is, you need to run this either in a dev environment or you need to have it run on a server!
In VSC you can do this with Live Server application (plugin).
